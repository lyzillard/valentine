  "wishText": "Zac,\n\nYou are the gravity that keeps me steady, the rhythm in my quiet moments, the warmth that lingers even when you’re not near. Loving you isn’t just a feeling—it’s a state of being, something as natural as breath, as certain as the sun rising even when I can’t see it.\n\nWhen I think of you, I think of the way light filters through leaves on a slow afternoon, how waves pull back only to return, the way ink seeps into paper and stays. You are in the smallest details of my day, in the space between heartbeats, in the silence that feels full instead of empty.\n\nI don’t need grand moments to know what you mean to me. I find you in the quiet, in the ordinary, in the way my heart settles at the thought of you. And in all the days ahead, I hope you know—you are my favorite constant.\n\nLyla",
